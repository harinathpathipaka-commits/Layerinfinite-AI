# Contributing to LayerInfinite

Thank you for contributing. LayerInfinite's open-source SDKs are the interface between the developer community and the platform — quality here matters more than anywhere else.

This document covers everything you need to make a meaningful contribution: environment setup, testing, commit conventions, the PR process, and how releases are cut.

## What Is and Is Not Open Source

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Python SDK | ✅ Open Source (MIT) | `sdks/python/` |
| TypeScript SDK | ✅ Open Source (MIT) | `sdks/typescript/` |
| Hosted API (`layerinfinite.me`) | ❌ Proprietary | Managed service |
| Dashboard (`layerinfinite.app`) | ❌ Proprietary | Managed service |
| Import pipeline | ❌ Proprietary | Managed service |

Pull requests, bug reports, and feature requests for the SDKs are fully welcome. Issues about the hosted platform or Dashboard are best directed to `team@layerinfinite.app`.

## Development Setup

### Python SDK Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.9+

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/harinathpathipaka-commits/Layerinfinite-AI.git
cd Layerinfinite-AI/sdks/python

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows (PowerShell)

# 3. Install the SDK in editable mode with all dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 4. Verify your setup
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Your environment is ready when all tests pass with no errors.

**Environment variables for local testing against a real API:**

```bash
export LAYERINFINITE_API_KEY="li_test_..."
export LAYERINFINITE_BASE_URL="https://layerinfinite.me"
```

Without these, the test suite uses mocked HTTP via `respx` and does not require a real API connection.

---

### TypeScript SDK Setup

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the TypeScript SDK
cd sdks/typescript

# 2. Install dependencies (exact lockfile)
npm ci

# 3. Run the full test suite
npm test

# 4. Type check
npm run typecheck

# 5. Build the distribution
npm run build
```

Your environment is ready when `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` both exit cleanly.

---

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Create your branch from `master` using one of these prefixes:

| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `feat/` | New features or methods |
| `docs/` | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor/` | Internal refactors with no behaviour change |
| `test/` | Adding or improving tests |
| `chore/` | Dependency bumps, CI changes |

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout -b fix/auto-fallback-timeout-handling
```

### What Counts as a Good Change

- **Bug fixes** must include a failing test that reproduces the bug, then passes after the fix.
- **New public methods or parameters** must include tests covering the happy path, the error path, and edge cases.
- **Behaviour changes** must update the relevant section of the SDK's `README.md` located inside the SDK directory.
- **Internal refactors** must not change any public API signatures.

---

## Testing

### Python

```bash
# Run the full suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run a single test file
python -m pytest tests/test_client.py -v

# Run tests matching a keyword
python -m pytest tests/ -k "test_auto_mode" -v

# Check coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=layerinfinite --cov-report=term-missing
```

The test suite uses `respx` to mock all HTTP calls. No real API key is required.

### TypeScript

```bash
# Run the full suite
npm test

# Run in watch mode during development
npx vitest

# Run with coverage
npx vitest run --coverage
```

---

## Commit Conventions

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every commit message must match this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Scope** (optional but encouraged): `python-sdk`, `ts-sdk`, `ci`, `docs`

**Examples:**

```
fix(python-sdk): handle ConnectionError during async outcome flush
feat(ts-sdk): add min_observations_per_action support to auto mode
docs: add exploration floor example to README
test(python-sdk): add coverage for LowConfidenceError fallback chain
chore(ci): bump pytest-httpx to 0.31
```

> **Breaking changes** must include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer and increment the minor version.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the public repository: `github.com/harinathpathipaka-commits/Layerinfinite-AI`
2. **Create your branch** from `master` following the naming convention above.
3. **Make your changes** with tests.
4. **Verify everything passes locally:**
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m pytest tests/ -q

   # TypeScript
   npm test && npm run typecheck
   ```
5. **Open the PR** against `master` with:
   - A clear title following the commit convention format
   - A description explaining *what* changed and *why*
   - A reference to any related issue (e.g. `Closes #42`)

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] New behaviour is covered by tests
- [ ] Public API changes are reflected in the SDK's `README.md`
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys, URLs, or credentials
- [ ] Commit messages follow the convention

PRs that fail CI (tests or typecheck) will not be reviewed until they are green.

## Release Process

> **Note:** Only maintainers cut releases. This section is for transparency.

Releases are **fully automated via GitHub Actions** and triggered by pushing a semver-matching Git tag. There is no manual build or upload step.

### Python SDK

```bash
# 1. Update version in sdks/python/pyproject.toml
# 2. Commit the version bump
git commit -m "chore(python-sdk): bump version to X.Y.Z"

# 3. Push the tag — this triggers the publish workflow
git tag sdk-python-vX.Y.Z
git push origin sdk-python-vX.Y.Z
```

The workflow (`publish-python-sdk.yml`) will:
1. Verify the tag version matches `pyproject.toml`
2. Run the full test suite
3. Build the `sdist` and `wheel`
4. Publish to PyPI using the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret
5. Create a GitHub Release

### TypeScript SDK

```bash
# 1. Update version in sdks/typescript/package.json
# 2. Commit the version bump
git commit -m "chore(ts-sdk): bump version to X.Y.Z"

# 3. Push the tag — this triggers the publish workflow
git tag sdk-ts-vX.Y.Z
git push origin sdk-ts-vX.Y.Z
```

The workflow (`publish-npm-sdk.yml`) will:
1. Verify the tag version matches `package.json`
2. Run the full test suite and typecheck
3. Build the distribution
4. Publish to npm as `@layerinfinite/sdk` using the `NPM_TOKEN` secret
5. Create a GitHub Release
